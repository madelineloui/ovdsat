# Analysis of Open Vocabulary Detection (OVD) and Few-Shot Detection (FSD) for Remote Sensing

TO-DO

* Make sure prototypes are well computed (extract features just like at model level)
* Fine-tune OWL-ViT on the different sets and add its curve to the plot
* Implement CLIP+RPN (and RemoteCLIP) approach by selecting the backbone
* Try sous-Ã©chantillonnage
